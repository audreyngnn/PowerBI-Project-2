## Project Overview
A comprehensive Power BI dashboard designed to optimize student retention rates across Macquarie Business School's Bachelor programs through data-driven intervention strategies and performance monitoring.

## Dashboard Structure

### 1. **Dashboard Summary**
Central hub displaying institution-wide KPIs:
- **8,289** total students across **49,721** enrollments
- **89.61%** retention rate with **8.31%** dropout rate
- Year-over-year retention improvement: **+3.33%**
- Performance benchmarking across 4 faculties and 1,014 units

### 2. **University Overview**
Macro-level insights for executive decision-making:
- Faculty-level fail rate vs. dropout rate comparison
- Course and unit rankings by dropout/fail rates
- Enrollment distribution and trends (2020-2025)
- Bottom 20 performers identification for targeted intervention

### 3. **Course Performance**
Deep-dive into course-level metrics:
- **82.64%** course retention rate (**+8.6%** vs. prior year)
- Student transfer patterns: **18.47%** transfer to other courses, **430** leave university
- **257** units with 100% pass rate vs. **572** units with <50% pass rate
- International vs. Domestic student progression tracking
- Top enrollment units (ACST1001: 1,497 students, 3.01% of total)

### 4. **Unit Performance**
Granular unit-level analysis (taking an example of ACCG2002):
- Individual unit pass rates, withdrawal rates, and grade distributions
- High achiever characteristics profiling
- Enrollment trends and year-over-year comparisons
- Risk identification for units with <0.01% enrollment

### 5. **What-If Scenarios**
Predictive modeling for retention optimization:

#### Intervention Programs & Impact:
- **Supplemental Instruction (SI)**: 40% coverage, 29% retention improvement → **5,150 DFW preventions**
- **Structured Mentoring Program**: 80% coverage, 43% retention improvement → **694 additional students retained**
- **Early Alert System**: 95% coverage, 10% improvement → **2,643 withdrawn students prevented**

#### Risk-Based Outcomes:
- High-risk students: Retention improvement from **4.91% → 12.91%**
- Medium-risk students: Retention improvement from **25.68% → 33.68%**
- Top impact units: ACST1001 (433 DFWs prevented), ECON1020 (399 DFWs prevented)

## Retention Optimization Framework

### Range Analysis Approach:
1. **High-Risk Range** (Dropout >50%): Intensive intervention required
2. **Medium-Risk Range** (Dropout 20-50%): Targeted support programs
3. **Low-Risk Range** (Dropout <20%): Maintenance and monitoring

### Optimization Levers:
- Resource allocation to bottom 20 courses/units
- Scaling successful units (257 with 100% pass rates) as benchmarks
- Transfer pattern analysis to reduce "Left University" cohort (430 students)
- Coverage expansion of proven interventions (SI, Mentoring, Early Alert)

## Key Insights
- **47% overall retention rate improvement** achievable through combined interventions
- **694-5,150 students** can be retained annually through optimized program deployment
- International full-time students show different progression patterns requiring tailored support
- Core vs. Flexi unit performance varies significantly, indicating curriculum optimization opportunities

## Technical Stack
- **Tool**: Power BI Desktop
- **Data Scope**: Academic Years 2020-2025
- **Stakeholders**: University Executives, Course Directors, Unit Convenors
- **Last Updated**: 16 Dec 2025, 09:47 PM

## Business Value
Enables evidence-based resource allocation decisions to maximize student retention ROI, reduce revenue loss from dropouts, and optimize support program coverage across the risk spectrum.
